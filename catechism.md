# Part I: Problem

**Why do we write papers?**

**How do I know whether a problem is good? / Whose suffering can I alleviate? Why should I care?**

- Someone is suffering because they don’t have access to your tool.
- Examples of bad/good problems:
    - Bad: We don’t know how to do foo.
    - Bad: Foo exists, but is practically too slow
    - Good: Users want to do foo, but they cannot, so they spend xxx hours doing bar instead, which is worse.
    

**Has the problem already been solved? What should I do then?**

- You will solve it better or in a new way, with your *insight*

# Part II: Insight

**Where does insight come from?**

**What does insight look like?**

A reusable conceptual contribution.

Examples:

- We can combine x and y to do z.
- X is secretly Y and Y tools and techniques apply!
- X is not the real problem. Y is the real problem. Realizing this makes solving the problem easier.

A general piece of advice, like, “codify expert opinion”? “Forget about correctness, and only check it at the end?” “We can allow users to take control of the algorithm in these ways”

**It seems difficult to produce an insight of value. Why can’t we just say what we did and let it be obvious why that works well for our problem?**

Insight serves as an answer to the question: If someone isn’t in your field, what can they take away from this paper? How can they apply your ideas to their own work?

**How can I tell that I have had the right insight?**

- You must identify a series of claims that your new solution will have.

# Part 3: Claims

**How can I tell which things are insights and which are claims?**

Claims tell us what we should judge the insight against. What makes the insight good.

We said something bold in the insight. People maybe didn’t believe us. Now it’s time for us to lay out what we would need to know for us to believe it, and hopefully the readers also agree.

**What kind of claims should I make about the work?**

The solution exists. The solution works.

The solution is fast. The solution is extensible.

**How do I know I have made the right claims?**

MEASURABLE. Need to be able to say whether you accomplished them or not, definitively. 

**Why should readers believe my claims?**

Because we supply them with evidence.

# Part 4: Evidence


# Part 5: Deliverance 

**Why do Problem, Insight, Claims, Evidence explain my paper's story?**
